# Fluvial experiment time-series helper

Our experiments of rivers and deltas involve:
* Topographic scans with arbitrary numbers
* Photos stamped with calendar date/time
* Changes in boundary conditions marked by runtimes
* Manual measurements marked by runtimes

This code base will help semi-automate a converion of the former two data sets onto a consistent time series by:
1. Setting the times of the scans
2. Renaming images appropriately
